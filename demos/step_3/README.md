- Collection status and timing information
- Multi-company collection support

### Step 8: System Statistics
- Storage performance metrics
- System health and capacity information
- Cross-collection analytics

## Key Technical Achievements

### Data Models
- **LinkedInProfile**: Complete user profile with validation
- **LinkedInPost**: Rich post model with engagement metrics
- **PostCollection**: Aggregated collection with metadata
- **CollectionMetadata**: Comprehensive tracking information

### Mock Data Quality
- Industry-specific content generation
- Realistic engagement patterns
- Multi-language support (EN, FR, NL)
- Time-distributed posting simulation

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive request/response models
- Error handling and validation
- Real-time progress tracking

### Performance Features
- Async/await throughout the system
- Concurrent collection from multiple sources
- Thread-safe storage operations
- Efficient search and filtering

## Running the Demo

```bash
# From the project root directory
cd demos/step_3
python demo.py
```

The demo will:
1. Start the FastAPI server automatically
2. Wait for server startup
3. Execute all demo steps sequentially
4. Show detailed progress and results
5. Keep the server running for manual testing
6. Clean up on exit

## Expected Output

The demo produces comprehensive output showing:

- ‚úÖ **Success indicators** for each major operation
- üìä **Statistics and metrics** for collection results
- üîç **Search results** with sample post content
- üìà **Analytics data** including sentiment analysis
- üíæ **Storage statistics** and system health

### Sample Metrics You'll See

- **50+ posts** collected across all sources
- **Multiple content sources**: Company pages, employee posts, mentions, hashtag searches
- **Realistic engagement**: Likes, comments, shares with proper distributions
- **Multi-language content**: English, French, Dutch posts
- **Sentiment analysis**: Positive/negative/neutral classification
- **Temporal distribution**: Posts spread across the collection period

## Testing the API Manually

After the demo completes, the server remains running. You can test endpoints manually:

```bash
# Get all collections
curl http://localhost:8000/data/collections

# Search posts in a collection
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/data/collections/{collection_id}/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "innovation", "limit": 10}'

# Get collection analytics
curl http://localhost:8000/data/collections/{collection_id}/analytics

# Check storage statistics
curl http://localhost:8000/data/storage/stats
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- Clear separation between data models, services, and APIs
- Abstract interfaces for future real API integration
- Pluggable storage backends

### Scalability Features
- Async operations throughout
- Configurable collection limits
- Efficient memory management
- Thread-safe operations

### Error Resilience
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed error reporting
- Recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

This demo validates the foundation for:
- Real LinkedIn API integration (Step 4)
- NLP analysis pipeline (Step 5)  
- Advanced analytics (Step 6)
- Export functionality (Step 7)
- Web interface (Step 8)

The mock data collection system provides a robust testing environment for all subsequent development phases.
