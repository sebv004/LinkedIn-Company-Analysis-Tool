   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn src.linkedin_analyzer.main:app --reload
   ```

5. Visit the API documentation:
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest tests/ -v

# Run linting
poetry run black src/ tests/
poetry run isort src/ tests/

## Architecture

The system follows a **processing pipeline architecture** with these core phases:

1. **Company Configuration Validation** - Verifies LinkedIn company pages and search parameters
2. **Data Collection** - Dynamic scraping/API calls based on company configuration  
3. **Text Cleaning and Preprocessing** - Company-specific noise filtering and language processing
4. **NLP Analysis** - Sentiment analysis, topic detection, NER, and trend forecasting
5. **Enrichment** - External entity linking and strategic insights categorization

## Current Status

**âœ… Step 1 Complete**: Project Foundation & Basic Web Framework
- FastAPI application with health check endpoint
- Comprehensive test suite
- Interactive demo
- Poetry-based dependency management

**ðŸš§ In Progress**: Migrating to Poetry for modern dependency management

## Next Steps

- Step 2: Company Configuration Data Models
- Step 3: Mock Data Collection System
- Step 4: Basic NLP Processing Pipeline
- Step 5: Basic Web Interface
