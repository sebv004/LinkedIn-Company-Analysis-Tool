# Step 4: Basic NLP Processing Pipeline - Demo Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive instructions for running and understanding the Step 4 demo, which showcases the complete NLP processing pipeline implementation. The demo demonstrates sentiment analysis, topic extraction, entity recognition, pipeline orchestration, and the analysis service.

## Demo Structure

The demo consists of five main sections:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Demo** - Individual sentiment analysis examples
2. **Topic Extraction Demo** - Topic identification from multiple texts
3. **Named Entity Recognition Demo** - Entity detection and classification
4. **NLP Processing Pipeline Demo** - Complete pipeline processing
5. **Analysis Service Demo** - End-to-end company analysis workflow

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Poetry package manager
- At least 2GB available RAM
- 1GB free disk space

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

2. **Install Optional NLP Models** (for best performance):

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Import Errors**
```
‚ùå Import error: No module named 'textblob'
```
**Solution**: Install missing dependencies
```bash
poetry install
pip install textblob vaderSentiment scikit-learn
```

**2. spaCy Model Missing**
```
OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'en_core_web_sm'
```
**Solution**: Download the spaCy model
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**3. Slow Performance**
```
Processing taking >10 seconds per batch
```
**Solution**: Check system resources and disable parallel processing
```bash
# Edit demo.py, set in PipelineConfig:
enable_parallel_processing=False
max_workers=1
```

**4. No Results Generated**
```
‚ùå No topics extracted
‚ùå Analysis failed
```
**Solution**: Check input data and component availability
- Verify text input is non-empty
- Check component status output
- Review error messages in console

### Performance Expectations

**System Requirements vs Performance**:

| System Spec | Processing Speed | Memory Usage |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| High-end (8+ cores, 16GB RAM) | <30ms/post | <500MB |
| Medium (4 cores, 8GB RAM) | <50ms/post | <300MB |
| Low-end (2 cores, 4GB RAM) | <100ms/post | <200MB |

**Library Impact**:
- **Full libraries**: Best accuracy and performance
- **Partial libraries**: Good accuracy, some features missing
- **Minimal setup**: Basic functionality, limited accuracy

### Debug Mode

To get more detailed output, modify the demo script:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Add at the beginning of main() function
```

This will provide detailed logging of:
- Component initialization
- Processing steps
- Error details
- Performance bottlenecks

## Customization Options

### Modifying Demo Behavior

**1. Change Analysis Configuration**:
```python
# In demo_processing_pipeline()
config = PipelineConfig(
    max_topics_per_text=5,        # More topics per text
    min_texts_for_topics=2,       # Lower threshold
    enable_parallel_processing=True,  # Enable/disable parallel
    supported_languages=['en', 'fr']  # Add more languages
)
```

**2. Add Custom Test Data**:
```python
# Add your own test texts
custom_texts = [
    "Your custom business text here...",
    "Another example post for analysis...",
]
```

**3. Focus on Specific Components**:
```python
# Comment out sections you don't want to run
# demo_sentiment_analysis()
# demo_topic_extraction()
demo_entity_recognition()  # Only run entity recognition
```

### Testing Different Scenarios

**1. Company Types**: Modify company configuration to test different industries
**2. Post Types**: Change LinkedIn post content to test various business scenarios  
**3. Languages**: Test with different language content (French, Dutch)
**4. Volume**: Increase batch sizes to test performance limits
